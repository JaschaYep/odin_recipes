    <p>Easy to make and very customizable, burritos are a perfect worknight dinner. Here's what you need and how you make them:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cilantro-lime rice</li>
        <li>Chipotle-spiced black bean</li>
        <li>Taco-spiced fajita veggies</li>
        <li>Zesty avocado cream sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>To a food processor, add avocado, cilantro, jalape√±o, garlic, lime juice, and sour cream (or Greek yogurt).</li>
        <li>Blend mixture stopping to scrap down the sides as needed, until mostly smooth. Set aside. </li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, combine dry rice with 2 cups of water and 1/2 tsp. salt. </li>
        <li>Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and gently simmer for 18 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed and rice is tender.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and stir in 3 Tbsp. chopped fresh cilantro, 1/2 tsp. lime zest, and 1 Tbsp. fresh lime juice.</li>
        <li> the rice cooks, heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Once hot, add bell peppers, poblano pepper, and red onion. Cook 7 to 9 minutes, stirring only occasionally, until tender. Stir in 1 Tbsp. taco seasoning and remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Drain and lightly rinse black beans. Shake off excess water and transfer to a bowl. Stir in adobo sauce, ground cumin, and a pinch of salt. Cover with a damp paper towel and microwave for 2 minutes, stopping at 1 minute to stir through, until warm.</li>
        <li>Assemble all parts and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
